### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Assistant Planner at [MCRPC](https://mcplan.org), a small metropolitan planning organization in Central Illinois. I do GIS, make maps (static & interactive), and analyze data in support of our transportation planning and comprehensive planning efforts. I also help update the website, work with the Greenways Advisory Committee, and serve as the unofficial office Tech Support Guy.

### Things I'm working on:

- Graduate Certificate in Digital Mapping through the UKY [New Maps Plus](https://newmapsplus.as.uky.edu/) program
- [census-template](https://github.com/mcrpc/census-template), a batch of R scripts that use packages like [tidycensus](https://github.com/walkerke/tidycensus) to download and process large amounts of data from the Census API into tables, charts, and maps. No more loss of sanity from trying to navigate [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/) or trying to manage table joins in ArcGIS!
- [route-66](https://github.com/mcrpc/route-66), a collection of information and photos of sites along Route 66 in McLean County. [This Story Map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/c165368dd2a944f18fadebdc4b5fa542) presents the data in an interactive format.
